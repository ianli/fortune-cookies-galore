Fortune Cookies Galore!
=======================

This is a collection of fortune cookie quotes that I have compiled from various sources around the Internet.

* `fortunes.txt` contains unique quotes from all the quotes in the `sources/` directory.
* `sources/` contains files with quotes from various locations in the Internet.

The code in `script/` helps filter out unique and similar lines.
